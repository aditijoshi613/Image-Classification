# Image Classification on Fashion MNIST Dataset 

### Problem Statement

In the realm of fashion retail, there's a pressing need to efficiently categorize clothing items into distinct classes for better inventory management and customer experience. The project focuses on leveraging the KNN algorithm to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into 10 predefined classes. I aim to explore various experiments to enhance model performance, including determining the optimal training dataset size, identifying the ideal method for splitting data into training and testing sets, and assessing the impact of data transformation through PCA on model accuracy.


### Data Description

The Fashion MNIST dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist?resource=download) consists of Zalandoâ€™s article images. There are 60000 training and 10000 test 28 x 28 greyscale images, each pixel value ranging from 0 to 255 indicating the lightness or darkness of the pixel. The datasets have 785 columns, the first corresponding to the label (0-9 for 10 classes) and the rest representing the 784 (28 x 28) pixel values.
